Use [the Waffle board](https://waffle.io/carlvlewis/ndoch17) for this repo or view the [Issues open](https://github.com/carlvlewis/ndoch17/issues) to get an overview and offer feedback/suggestions/ideas for NDOCH Savannah '17 (Sept. 23rd).


## Theme/Topic/Dataset Proposal

#### Proposal A (pending discussion with Saja re: cohesion with Neighborhoods site)
How might we use creative technology and open data to strengthen andq

##### Topline summary
Design/prototype a minimum viable product for a system that might better connect disparate neighborhood associations with one another to unite among shared political, civic or community causes.

##### Description
Savannah has a long and rich history of politically and civically active neighborhood associations, with a robust ecosystem of 59 such associations spanning across the city's formal boundaries. But despite their robust numbers, Savannah's neighborhood associations often lack the time, money, political capital, dedicated leadership and organizational infrastructure to exert the full scope of influence on City decision-making that they potentially could if more concrete processes were in place that better fostered inter-association collaboration, and technologies developed to help connect disparate, distributed actors in different neighborhoods in shared collective action in a timely manner. While The City of Savannah's new Neighborhoods website is a solid step in this direction, it primarily tackles the issue from an informational angle rather than an action-oriented angle.

For this Civic Hackathon challenge, teams will be tasked with designing, devising and pitching a potential open-source system that will foster stronger and more tactical inter-neighborhood collaboration and empower more effective community action in influencing decisions made by City Hall. While each team's system should ideally make use of new digital technologies to form the backbone of its communication and collaboration strategy, the solution need not be limited to the world of software alone. The strongest entries will apply a systems-thinking approach to the problem that may involve an array of different experimental modes of civic engagement. Building a technologically-brilliant piece of software without having a solid plan to incentivize neighborhood buy-in, a feedback mechanism to encourage the participation of elected officials and marketing strategies that both attract and retain citizen engagement will be less likely to accomplish the product's end goals.
